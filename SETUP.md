# 🚀 Setup Instructions

Your new profile README uses **GitHub Actions** to generate stat cards — they're stored as SVGs directly in your repo, so they **never break** (unlike the old Vercel-based services).

## Step-by-step setup (takes ~3 minutes):

### 1. Replace your README.md
Copy the new `README.md` into your `EmperorAkashi20/EmperorAkashi20` repo (the profile repo), replacing the old one.

### 2. Add the GitHub Actions workflow
Copy the entire `.github/` folder into your repo root. The file structure should be:
```
EmperorAkashi20/
├── .github/
│   └── workflows/
│       └── profile-summary-cards.yml
└── README.md
```

### 3. Run the workflow
1. Go to your repo → **Actions** tab
2. Click **"GitHub Profile Summary Cards"** in the left sidebar
3. Click **"Run workflow"** → **"Run workflow"** (green button)
4. Wait ~30 seconds — it will auto-commit a `profile-summary-card-output/` folder with your SVG stat cards

### 4. Done!
The workflow runs every 6 hours automatically to keep your stats fresh.

## What's different from before?

| Before (broken) | Now (bulletproof) |
|---|---|
| `github-readme-stats.vercel.app` — rate-limited, frequently down | SVGs generated by GitHub Actions, stored in your repo |
| `github-profile-trophy.vercel.app` — broken images | Removed (was showing broken placeholder) |
| `streak-stats.herokuapp.com` — Heroku deprecated | `streak-stats.demolab.com` — official maintained host |

## Streak stats still not loading?

The streak card from `streak-stats.demolab.com` can occasionally be slow. If it's consistently broken for you, you can self-host it:
1. Fork https://github.com/DenverCoder1/github-readme-streak-stats
2. Deploy the `vercel` branch to your own Vercel account
3. Replace `streak-stats.demolab.com` with `your-project.vercel.app` in the README
